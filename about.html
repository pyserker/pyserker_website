                    Where did PYSERKER come from? While building a site to torment my students, I reflected on my own torment while taking similar classes and learning several coding languages at the same time. I specifically remember CSS looking like JSON in the middle of the night, and my feelings toward JavaScript became a seething hatred while I wanted to focus on Python. But, I really donâ€™t hate JavaScript, it was just a conflict at the time. I did go berserk for a while. As I achieved some traction with Python, I went Berserker with it, and am pretty much still on that path. So, Berserker became Pyserker. Corny I know, most geeky puns are only funny at the time, but the name stuck.
