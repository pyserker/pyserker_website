                The purpose of this site is to demonstrate concepts to students. So, things are going to get weird! It will be under construction at all times and things will look off from time to time. There will be a mismatch of elements, sometimes bordering on chaos. Maybe down the road it will become more than demonstrative and develop into a site with just demonstrative pages. But for now, MADNESS!

                Where did PYSERKER come from? While building a site to torment my students, I reflected on my own torment while taking similar classes and learning several coding languages at the same time. I specifically remember CSS looking like JSON in the middle of the night, and my feelings toward JavaScript became a seething hatred while I wanted to focus on Python. But, I really donâ€™t hate JavaScript, it was just a conflict at the time. I did go berserk for a while. As I achieved some traction with Python, I went Berserker with it, and am pretty much still on that path. So, Berserker became Pyserker. Corny I know, most geeky puns are only funny at the time, but the name stuck.</div>
